# Enhanced solar and wind potential during widespread temperature extremes across several U.S. energy grids

In this repository, you will find all code used to conduct the analyses for the manuscript "Enhanced solar and wind potential during widespread temperature extremes across several U.S. energy grids" by Deepti Singh, Yianna Bekris, Cassandra D.W. Rogers, James Doss-Gollin, Ethan D. Coffel, and Dmitri A. Kalashnikov.

All meteorological data were originally downloaded at the hourly resolution from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al. 2020). NERC region data were downloaded from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Database (HIFLD). Outage data are annual summaries of electrical disturbances from 2012-2021 compiled by the U.S. Department of Environment (DOE) Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (“ISER - Electric Disturbance Events (DOE-417)” n.d.).
